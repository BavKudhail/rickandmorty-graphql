# Rick and Morty Database

## The Goal
After coming across Apollo and GraphQl, I wanted to deepen my knowledge of these technologies through building an application. 
I decided to create a very simple Rick and Morty character list to understand how Apollo Client can be used to get fetch data from a graphQL api.

## Technologies used

* Apollo Client
* React
* GraphQl
* TailwindCSS
